For Module 1

This Java project takes in a file called "data.txt" as the expected input from my personal file path listed. It then sorts the data in ascending order, and creates a new file with the sorted data called "data-sorted.txt" as the expected output.

In this Java class assignment, we learned about file input and output as well as a Java library method called "java.util.Collections.sort()."
